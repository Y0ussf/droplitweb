                A young man named Raskolnikov, overwhelmed by poverty, paranoia,
                and hypochondria, reluctantly embarks on a mysterious errand. He
                visits an old pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, to pawn a silver
                watch. After a tense negotiation, Raskolnikov leaves feeling
                agitated. He seeks solace in a tavern, where he encounters a
                group of drunk men and a retired government clerk. Despite
                feeling more at ease temporarily, he remains disturbed by his
                thoughts and actions.

                Raskolnikov, feeling lonely and weary, seeks company at a
                tavern. He encounters a disheveled drunk named Marmeladov, who
                recounts the dire poverty and desperation his family endures,
                including his daughter, Sonia, who now resorts to prostitution.
                Marmeladov laments his own failings, wallowing in his
                predicament. Despite the tragic tale, Marmeladov speaks with
                hope of redemption, stirring a brief silence among the
                listeners. Then, he abruptly decides to visit his wife, and
                Raskolnikov, who had been listening, offers to accompany him. A
                man, Marmeladov, and Raskolnikov enter a dilapidated room where
                they find Marmeladov's wife, Katerina Ivanovna, in distress. The
                family is impoverished and the children are suffering.
                Marmeladov is accused of drinking away their money, and a
                chaotic scene unfolds with Marmeladov humiliated and the family
                in despair. Raskolnikov, feeling conflicted, briefly considers
                helping but ultimately leaves. As he walks back, he ponders
                human nature and the suffering around him.

                Raskolnikov wakes up in his small, rundown room feeling
                ill-tempered. His landlady has stopped bringing him meals, and
                the cook, Nastasya, isn't cleaning his room as often. Nastasya
                wakes him and gives him tea, and he sends her to buy bread and
                sausage. She brings him cabbage soup instead, and he reluctantly
                eats it. Nastasya talks to him about his situation, and he
                admits he's thinking and wants to make a fortune. He receives a
                letter from his mother, informing him that his sister, Dunya,
                faced hardship at the Svidrigailovs' house but is now engaged to
                a man, Pyotr Petrovitch. His mother plans to visit with Dunya
                soon. Initially emotional, Raskolnikov becomes angry and leaves
                the room, walking without direction in a disturbed state of
                mind.

        Droplits subscriptions provide direct support to content creators,
        enabling them to continue producing high-quality summaries and expanding
        the platform's offerings. Subscriptions help cover production costs,
        support the growth of the community, and incentivize creators to produce
        more content.

        Droplits subscriptions are tied to individual accounts and cannot be
        shared with family members through a family plan. Each user must
        subscribe individually to access premium features and exclusive content.

        saved to your device for playback without an internet connection.

        Currently, Droplits summaries are curated and produced by a team of
        experts. However, Droplits may explore community-driven features in the
        future, allowing users to contribute summaries and participate in
        content creation.
